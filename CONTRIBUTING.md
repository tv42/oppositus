# Contributing

We welcome contributions, please create a Github pull request at
https://github.com/tv42/oppositus. If your intended contribution is
more than a small bugfix, we ask that you first open an issue to
discuss the design.

To keep legal matters clear, we use the DCO concept from the Linux
Kernel project. Since this is a smaller project without the
organizational structure of Linux, we use a one-time addition of your
name to the list of authors, instead of a repeated Signed-Off-By line
in every commit. Additionally, we don't want the overhead of restating
the license in every file, the top level `LICENSE` file suffices.


Please read and agree to the following:

Contributions are licensed by their authors under the MIT license as
indicated in the file `LICENSE`. Contributors certify the following:
